When we were in our groups, we were told we could just work together on this project having one student be the scribe.
Because we did this none of us were added as collaborators on the project.  We were able to write several test cases
and implement the function code for calculateDiscount.  I later changed it to throw an error instead of return an empty array just to try it out.
As a group we also completed one test case for the filterProducts function.  We didn't get a chance to add code to the funcion.
All the rest of the assigment was completed on my own.  I assume that is what I was supposed to do.
